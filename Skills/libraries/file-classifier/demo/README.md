# File Classifier — Demo Content

Demo content for the [file-classifier](../) skill. Use these sample files to set up a working demo of the skill in SharePoint.

## What's included

The `sample-files/` folder contains 12 documents covering the full range of content types the skill classifies:

- **5 Contracts** — Supply Agreement, Service Level Agreement, Consulting Services Agreement, NDA, and a commercial office Lease
- **4 Invoices** — including a Credit Memo (negative amount) to demonstrate subtype handling
- **3 Purchase Orders** — raw materials, cloud services, and fleet vehicles

The set deliberately includes edge cases the skill is designed to handle correctly:
- A Supply Agreement that mentions invoices and payment terms (still classifies as Contracts because of the bilateral structure)
- A Credit Memo with a negative total amount
- An NDA with no financial value (ContractValue = 0)

## Setup

1. Create or open a SharePoint document library.
2. Upload all files from `sample-files/` into the library.
3. Install the [file-classifier](../) skill into your SharePoint Skills library (see the skill's README for install steps).
4. From a Copilot agent, ask: *"Classify the files in this library."*

## What to expect

The agent will:
- Create a `File classification` Choice column on the library
- Read each file's content and classify it as Contracts, Invoices, Purchase Orders, or Unclassified
- Create the appropriate metadata columns (5 per content type)
- Extract values from each file and populate the metadata columns
